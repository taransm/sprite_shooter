## Description:
I have built a challenge-based Augmented Reality shooting game using ARKit and written in Swift. I added 2D/3D elements to the live view from the deviceâ€™s camera, making those elements appear to inhabit the real world. The gameplay is simple, just look around you and shoot every enemy!

The score is stored using <strong> Firebase </strong>. This allows users to compete against their highest score. With this app you can convert any environment like park, library, restaurant (the limit is your imagination!) into a real world game.
## Design & Implementation: 
I used ARKit to combine device motion tracking, camera scene capture, advanced scene processing, and display conveniences, simplifying the task of building an AR experience. To enhance the gaming experience, I added sound effects and background music using AVPlayer. The app also contains multiple classes for various functionalities, including ARSKView, ARSession, ARFrame, ARAnchor, and SpriteKit (SKScene, SKSpriteNode, SKAction, SKNode). I utilized Cocoapods for managing external libraries.
